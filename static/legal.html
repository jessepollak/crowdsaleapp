<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in"><B>2.3 Delivery
Method.</B> The method by which we make the Rep available will depend
upon your method of purchase.  If you purchased Rep with ether, we
will send the appropriate amount of Rep to the Ethereum address from
which your ether was sent.  If you purchased Rep with Bitcoin
directly or through a third party payment processor, we will spend

legally entitled to an exemption from any sales, use, or similar
transaction tax, you are responsible for providing us with
legally-sufficient tax exemption certificates for each taxing
jurisdiction. We will apply the tax exemption certificates to charges
under your account occurring after the date we receive the tax
exemption certificates. If any deduction or withholding is required
by law, you will notify us and will pay us any additional amounts
necessary to ensure that the net amount that we receive, after any
deduction and withholding, equals the amount we would have received
if no deduction or withholding had been required. Additionally, you
will provide us with documentation showing that the withheld and
deducted amounts have been paid to the relevant taxing authority.</P>

(including the interpretation and scope of this Section and the

resolve any such controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of

mean Augur.  In addition, &ldquo;we&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo;
include any third party providing any product, service, or benefit in

cause of action subject to this Section.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in">Arbitration will be
subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration
law.  The arbitration will be conducted before one commercial
arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;)
with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract
disputes.  As modified by this Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed
upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by
the AAA&rsquo;s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator
deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
Related Disputes (collectively, the &ldquo;Rules and Procedures&rdquo;).
 Where no claims or counterclaims exceed $10,000, the dispute will be
resolved by the submission of documents without a hearing, unless a
hearing is requested by a party or deemed necessary by the
arbitrator, in which case, a party may elect to participate
telephonically.</P>

rights EXCEPT for matters that you file in small claims court in the
state or municipality of your residence within the jurisdictional
limits of the small claims court and as long as such matter is only
pending in that court.  Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement
to arbitrate, claims of defamation, and infringement or
misappropriation of the other party&rsquo;s patent, copyright,
trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration
agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or
federal courts located in San Francisco, California.  Additionally,
notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, you or we may seek
emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located
in San Francisco, California in order to maintain the status quo
pending arbitration and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco,
California for such purpose.  A request for interim measures shall
not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in">Your rights will be
determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury.  You are
entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures may be
SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. 
Arbitrators&rsquo; decisions are as enforceable as any court order
and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in">You and we must
abide by the following rules: (a) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US
MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY&rsquo;S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS
A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
PROCEEDING; (b) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE
PERSON&rsquo;S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE
RELIEF; (c) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the
costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of
litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in
connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to
prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to
the cost of litigation, (d) we also reserve the right, in our sole
and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for any or all of
the costs of the arbitration; (e) the arbitrator will honor claims of
privilege and privacy recognized at law; (f) the arbitration will be
confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence,
content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by
applicable law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration
award; (g) subject to the limitation of liability provisions of these
Terms, the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual
remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law; and (h) you
and we will pay our respective attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses,
unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing
party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator
awards such attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses to the prevailing
party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be
determined by the applicable law.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in">This Section will
survive termination of your account and this Agreement as well as any
voluntary payment of any debt in full by you or any bankruptcy by you
or us.  With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) above of this
Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if
any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid,
unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and
Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision will
remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms
as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not
contained herein.  If, however, either subpart (a) or (b) above of
this Section is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then
the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and
neither you nor we will be entitled to arbitration.  If for any
reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the
dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court
located in San Francisco, California.</P>
